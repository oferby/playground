# You're given a list of n integers arr[0..(n-1)]. You must compute a list output[0..(n-1)] such that,
# for each index i (between 0 and n-1, inclusive), output[i] is equal to the median of the elements arr[0..i]
# (rounded down to the nearest integer).
#
# The median of a list of integers is defined as follows. If the integers were to be sorted, then:
#
#     If there are an odd number of integers, then the median is equal to the middle integer in the sorted order.
#     Otherwise, if there are an even number of integers, then the median is equal to the average of the two
#     middle-most integers in the sorted order.
