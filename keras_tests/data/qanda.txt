An Elastic Cloud Server (ECS) is a computing server consisting of vCPUs, memory, image,
and Elastic Volume Service (EVS) disks that allow on-demand allocation and elastic scaling.
*
ECSs integrate Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), virtual firewalls, and multi-data-copy capabilities
to create an efficient, reliable, and secure computing environment. This ensures stable and
uninterrupted operation of services.
*
After creating an ECS, you can use it like using your local
computer or physical server.
*
ECSs support self-service creation, modification, and operation. You can create ECSs by specifying
the vCPU, memory, image specifications, and login authentication.
*
After creating an ECS, you
can modify its specifications as required.
*
ECS works with other products and services to provide computing, storage, network, and image installation functions.
*
ECSs are deployed in multiple availability zones (AZs) connected with each other through an internal network.
*
If an AZ becomes faulty, other AZs in the same region will not be affected.
*
With the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service, you can build a dedicated network, set the subnet and security group,
and allow the VPC to communicate with the external network through an EIP (bandwidth support required).
*
With the Image Management Service (IMS), you can install images on ECSs, or create ECSs using private images and
deploy services quickly.
*
The Elastic Volume Service (EVS) provides storage and Volume Backup Service (VBS) provides data backup and recovery
functions.
*
Cloud Container Engine (CCE) is a highly reliable and high-performance service that allows enterprises to manage
containerized applications. With support for Kubernetes-native applications and tools, CCE makes it simple to set
up an environment for running containers on the cloud.
*
Cloud Container Engine (CCE) provides one-stop application deployment and O&M, customizable DevOps continuous delivery, and auto scaling.
*
A Bare Metal Server (BMS) is a physical server dedicated for individual tenants. It provides remarkable
computing performance and stability for running key applications.
*
The Bare Metal Server (BMS) service can be used in conjunction
with other cloud services, such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), so that you can enjoy consistent and stable
performance of server hosting as well as the high scalability of cloud resources.
*
Auto Scaling (AS) is a service that automatically adjusts resources based on your service requirements and
configured AS policies.
*
You can specify Auto Scaling (AS) configurations and policies based on service requirements. These
configurations and policies free you from having to repeatedly adjust resources to keep up with service changes
and demand spikes, helping you reduce the resources and manpower required.
*
An image is an Elastic Cloud Server (ECS) or a Bare Metal Server (BMS) template that contains an operating
system (OS) or service data, necessary applications, such as database software, and some private software.
*
Dedicated Host (DeH) is a service that provides dedicated physical hosts. You can create ECSs on a DeH to
enhance isolation, security, and performance of your ECSs.
*
When you migrate services to a Dedicated Host (DeH), you can continue
to use your server software licenses used before the migration. That is, you can use the Bring Your Own
License (BYOL) feature on the DeH to reduce costs and independently manage your ECSs.
*
FunctionGraph hosts and computes functions in a serverless context. It automatically scales to suit fluctuations
in resource demands during peaks and spikes while requiring no reservation of dedicated servers or capacities.
*
With FunctionGraph, you will be billed based on actual usage.
*
Cloud Container Instance (CCI) provides a serverless container engine, eliminating the need to manage clusters
or servers.
*
Cloud Container Instance (CCI) delivers container agility and high performance with only three steps. CCI allows you to create
stateless workloads (Deployments). CCI enhances container security isolation, fast workload deployment, elastic
load balancing, auto scaling, and blue-green deployment based on the Kubernetes workload model.
*
ServiceStage is a one-stop PaaS service that provides cloud-based application hosting, simplifying application
lifecycle management, from deployment, monitoring, O&M, to governance. It provides a microservice framework
compatible with mainstream open-source ecosystems and enables quick building of distributed applications.
*
Distributed Message Service (DMS) is a message middleware service based on distributed, high-availability
clustering technology. It provides reliable, scalable, fully managed queues for storing messages.
*
Distributed Message Service (DMS) enables you to create message queues for transmitting messages among
application components. With DMS, application components that send messages and components that receive
messages do not have to be available at the same time.
*
Simple Message Notification (SMN) is a reliable and flexible large-scale message notification service.
It enables you to efficiently send messages to email addresses, phone numbers, and HTTP/HTTPS servers
and connect cloud services through notifications, reducing system complexity.
*
Cloud Service Engine (CSE) provides enterprises with a high-performance microservice framework, including
a microservice software development kit (SDK) and service registration, configuration, and governance centers.
*
Cloud Service Engine (CSE) helps you construct microservices quickly and monitor them in real time, and
guarantees their high availability (HA).
*
Cloud Service Engine (CSE) is also compatible with mainstream open-source ecosystems,
is not bound to specific development frameworks or platforms, and supports service code access to CSE
without any modification.
*
Huawei Application Performance Management (APM) is a cloud service that monitors and manages cloud application
performance and faults in real time.
*
Huawei Application Performance Management (APM) provides professional distributed application performance analysis
capabilities to help O&M personnel quickly resolve problems such as error assessments and removal of
performance bottlenecks in the distributed architecture and ensure user experience.
*
Application Operations Management (AOM) is a one-stop, three-dimensional O&M management platform for cloud
applications.
*
Application Operations Management (AOM) monitors your applications and related cloud resources in real time,
collects and associates the data of resource metrics, logs, and events to analyze application health statuses,
and provides flexible alarms and abundant data visualization functions.
*
Application Operations Management (AOM) helps you detect faults timely and master the real-time running statuses
of applications, resources, and services.
*
You can use Application Operations Management (AOM) to comprehensively monitor and uniformly manage servers,
storage devices, networks, web containers, and applications hosted in Docker and Kubernetes. This effectively
prevents problems and helps O&M personnel locate faults in minutes, reducing O&M costs.
