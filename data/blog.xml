        I have done such a good job for so long pusing aside my personal feelings, wants, and desires... now they all
        seem to be piling up on me. Part of me is glad I feel alone, because at least it means Im not hurting anyone
        else... But there is that duality too... I cant accept that, otherwise I would not feel alone... I think about
        her wanting to meet my parents... I couldnt afford to give her the life I would want to give her... Im so far in
        debt right now... I wonder if I will end up my fathers son afterall.

        I never said this before, but my Dad is in Jail. Funny thing is I am kind of glad he got what he diserved and I
        hope they keep him for a while... I doubt they will though. At least my mom wasnt home when he tore the house up
        and threatened my brother with a razor. Ive kept so much bottled up and private... Here is something I wrote a
        while back when I was seeing a counsellor. We moved around a lot when I was growing up... I distinctly remember
        living in at least six different houses, not counting the times my mom fled to my aunts or my grandparents to
        get away from my dad. It was always hard to make new friends or leave existing ones behind... I remember not
        wanting to bring new friends home because they would have to meet my parents and most likely see them fighting
        and arguing, I didn't want them to see me like that. There was also the use of drugs my homes, the quite casual
        pot smoking among my parents, their friends, and my relatives. My dad also had no problem walking around the
        house in just his underwear, something I had a serious problem with because there were times when I had friends
        over and he would just walk out in his underwear... it was quite embarrassing for me and another reason not to
        have people over. As long as I can remember my Dad has always had a drinking problem. When he drinks he gets
        confrontational and violent, at times we would try and be quiet to just try and not wake him up if he was
        sleeping... he always seemed grumpy. My mom and him would always argue and fight.... Generally over stupid
        trivial things, not anything I would deem important. Just about any time there was a verbal argument it turned
        into a physical thing with my dad hitting my mom. When I was really young I was powerless to stop it, we would
        leave and go to the house of my moms friends or stay with relatives to get away from him if it got really bad. I
        remember one time when I was living at Camp lake, my dad got really drunk and we were all scared, we went down
        to my Aunt Kathy's house and were hiding in the bedroom. My dad came knocking on the door and when Kathy
        wouldn't let him in he beat the door open and was coming for my mom, my brother and I. I was so scared and
        crying and then I think to stop him my Aunt Kathy hit him over the head with a frying pan or the flat edge of a
        meat cleaver and knocked him out... I think the police came after that, but they never really did anything. The
        above scene was repeated more times than I can remember, with different friends or relatives, or even just
        fighting in our home... Our neighbors stopped speaking to us because my Mom just stayed with my Dad no matter
        what... The police came, but they wouldn't do anything.. maybe take him away for a day or something but nothing
        more than that. I tried talking to a school counselor, but he just called my parents in and they denied our home
        life was that bad. That was probably the last time I spoke up about things growing up 6th or 7th grade I think.
        He would even get into fights with my mom when her friends and relatives would come and visit, accuse her of
        things that were just absurd... Like cheating and the like. With my grandparents or my aunts over, it didn't
        matter to him. One time he threw all of my aunts luggage outside because he didn't want them to be there
        anymore... If we left the house when he was like this he would always lock the doors and lock us out. I do not
        know how many times I had to climb in through a window in order to let my family back into the house. As I got
        older I started to stand up for myself, and my mom. This would generally result in me being hit or choked or
        pinned down while my dad yelled and screamed in my face. Until the point finally came where I could fight
        back... It took a little while for him to realize that I would not allow myself or my mom to be beat on when I
        was around. I pinned him down a few times, hit him, and always he would tell the police I was just a violent
        son. My mom of course would back his story and so they would not do anything with my dad. He would always
        threaten me or my material items I treasured... He would break my toys and then blame me for it. One time he
        threatened to throw my card collection in the bath tub in the heat of an argument and I lost it. I tackled him
        outside and pushed him to the ground. I hit him a couple of times and words were exchanged. When I let him up he
        said he was still going to do it and started walking towards the house. I picked up a bike lock and threw it at
        him. It hit him in the back of the head and knocked him out... I stood there watching as he lay on the ground
        twitching... When the police came that time, my mom stood beside my dad and told them that I had started the
        fight and that I had assaulted my father... If she had told the truth they would have taken him to Jail...
        Instead they took me to Juvenile detention. While I was there I resolved that I would never allow myself to be
        betrayed by my mom like that again. I was done getting hurt and I had proved to myself that I could defend
        myself if needed. Mom and Dad still argued and fought and sometimes I did keep him from hitting her, but he knew
        he couldn't beat me anymore and generally didn't try to... most of the time he just would fight and hit my mom
        when I was away... she of course would never say anything about it, just be crying when I got home. My mom's
        friends and family stopped coming over, stopped being around... I watched week by week as the people she knew
        didn't want to be around her because of my dad. They tried and tried to get her away from there and only got to
        see him be an asshole and destroy things because of it. Eventually after enough times of her leaving and going
        back to him they just stopped coming over anymore. Aside from the abuse there was the drug use in my home. Both
        my parents smoke cigarettes and marijuana, in fact most of my relatives also do. Many of my family relatives
        drink and some I would even consider alcoholics. It was always uncomfortable with such a casual drug attitude in
        my home. It seemed that I could not have people over because they would know about my family's drug habits… They
        didn’t exactly go to any effort to hide what they did. I almost never had friends over because between that and
        the fighting it was not something I wanted to my friends to be exposed to or to think less of me because of it.
        Most of the times I would go over to other peoples houses on the weekends, I spent very little time at home and
        whenever one of my friends wanted to come to my home I was always nervous about it and worried constantly that
        they would think less of me because of my home life. I always have been embarrassed by my parents. They lack any
        tact or manners when socializing with other people, they have very little respect for other peoples opinions,
        and are not tolerant of people with different racial/sexual backgrounds. I remember numerous times hearing about
        the fag or queer cousin, the dyke cousin and her girlfriend, so and so and that nigger. It really upset me, but
        I always just bit my tongue and never said anything even though my point of view differed. I guess I never
        really thought I could speak up and say what was on my mind. I did not feel that I would be respected for having
        my own opinion and would probably be ostracized for my views. I guess this was out of fear of my dad, I guess it
        seemed that he got upset anytime anyone had an opinion different than his, and such encounters would normally
        end either in violence or him stomping off to his room and slamming doors or breaking something around the
        house. I guess he did that quite a bit, if there wasn’t fighting or violence, he would punch holes in walls,
        break things like dishes… pull the phone out of the wall and smash it… he always did that.. To make it harder
        for us to call the police I suppose… always wrecking things we cared about, things that made us happy… bikes,
        cars… I cant count the number of times he would hit a windshield with his fist… Either while my mom and him were
        arguing in the car, or because we had gotten into the car and were trying to get away from him. He liked to take
        the car keys a lot too when they fought, I remember that… he didn’t want us to leave or call for anyone. If I
        wasn’t sticking up for my mom or if they were just arguing and it had not escalated to violence, I would
        normally just hide in my room… turn the radio up loud to drown out the arguing and the screaming. A few times I
        remember locking my door to hide from him because I was scared, but he would just break the door down, so I
        stopped locking it. I remember him threatening to call my teachers and tell them things… I don’t remember what
        things, just more threats that would affect how people outside of my home viewed me and that always generally
        got me in a confrontational mood with him before I learned to detach myself. A lot of times it was like that if
        he couldn’t be happy then no one was allowed to be happy or have things they treasured. At school I was always
        considered a bright kid I guess, but I didn’t really like to do homework. I would always score remarkably well
        on tests and had no problem understanding or explaining material in most of my subjects. But homework meant
        staying at home, and this was something I tried to avoid as much as possible… it was not a quiet place to work
        most of the time and there were a couple times where my Dad actually ripped up my homework during a fight. This
        really became a problem later in high school where I could not get by on test scores and class work alone. I was
        in advanced math and computer classes and it became really difficult for me to give my classes the attention
        they needed outside of school. This is also about the time we had a large number of family problems, My dad
        started doing harder drugs around this time… I am pretty sure cocaine, and I think my mom might have been too
        but I don’t know for sure. Anyways my parents were not paying their taxes on the house they bought and we were
        evicted… we moved into an apartment complex and were eventually evicted because of noise complaints involving my
        dad and also because of my parents failure to pay the rent. I was working a lot of hours and going to school at
        this time just to help out with the bills and stuff because m dad wasn't working… but it wasn't enough. After
        that I went and lived with my Grandmother for a while, my dad was also living there. My mom and my brother were
        living in a place down in Grand Rapids in a very poor neighborhood. The place was full of mice. I ended up there
        for a while before the place was condemned and I think I moved to my aunts at that point. Then back in with my
        Grandmother so I could work and go to school… Then back to my aunts and found an apartment my mom and I could
        afford in Grand Rapids. After living there and working for a while my Dad moved back in… I am not quite sure how
        this happened but it did. The fighting continued and the cops came a few times. I took an opportunity to move
        out of state at this point… but my parents did not continue to pay the rent and were evicted… instead of saying
        anything to me they just let it happen and I had a judgment for the eviction on my credit report. I eventually
        got that paid off while I was out of state though. When I was at my grandmas, my dad would get into fights with
        me all the time… always arguing sometimes hitting me. It scared my grandmother, his mom, quite a bit but she
        would never do anything. My uncles would come over and talk to him, try and get my grandma to kick him out… but
        she wouldn’t… I was really struggling in school between all my hours at work to help out and the stress of life
        at home and eventually was forced to drop out of school because I had missed too much time. This is something I
        regret to this day, but in spite of that I have managed to accomplish a lot. He would be gone for long hours and
        associate with people my mom insisted were supplying him with cocaine, I even found a crack pipe in his pants on
        more than one occasion. The police would never do anything though.

        Tomorrow I turn 25. I have made some great progress in loosing weight and getting into shape, but I still have
        alot of body fat I wish to loose. I am going to start a urlLink Cyclical Ketogenic Diet (CKD) . This diet is
        basically a low carb, high protien, high fat diet designed for people who are active. Atkins is really meant
        more for sedintary people and results in a fair amount of loss of muscle mass. Ive heard good things about this
        diet, and so I look forward to trying it to see if I can really loose some of this body fat I want to loose. I
        am going to start by eating less than 20 grams of carbs a day for the next two weeks, then I will start my Carb
        Loading July 11th. This should ensure my body is in Ketosis and a good starting point for my diet. I am going
        tin increase my my exercise level, and I may try eating 6 small meals a day instead of three larger meals. I am
        going to keep track of my progress on my blog. Once a week I will post my stats.. Body Measurements Weight 195 %

        urlLink Are all voluntary acts selfish? Whenever you do something for someone else, you get a level of self
        satisfaction, we all know that. In order for a deed to be in the category of self-less, there should be no
        benefit to the doer of the good deed. Feeling good about doing the deed, would disqualify it from being selfless
        since you are receiving benefit. So, is there really such a thing as a SELFLESS good deed? Extend this to
        friendship... Selfishness manifests itself in every action of which Humans, and all other animals partake. If it
        were not for the seeking of self gratification or gain no action would be engaged. Therefore the manifestation
        of selfishness is everywhere around us all the time, in every action, for if there were no selfishness there
        would be no action. Just solving the basic pains of the body which are the need for food, water, shelter are
        selfish actions; after all we do not engage them for another. Even pity is" the imagining of a like calamity
        befalling one self" - Thomas Hobbes

        Last couple of days have been hell at work, long long hours... Im too tired to write more. If we don't change,
        we don't grow. If we don't grow, we are not really living. Growth demands a temporary surrender of security. It
        may mean a giving up of familiar but limiting patterns, safe but unrewarding work, values no longer believed in,
        relationships that have lost their meaning. As Dostoevsky put it, 'Taking a new step, uttering a new word, is
        what people fear most.' The real fear should be of the opposite course. - Gail Sheehy

        Wow, what a weekend. Aside from one very down moment I had alot of fun this weekend. Drinking, playing video
        games, exercising, watchin movies... A little bit of everything. Im such a light weight now, I guess losing
        90lbs or so it makes sense that I cant drink like I used to... One bottle of Pinot Noir and I was done saturday
        night. I got a chance to talk to Lindsay a bit more, she's a great gal and I am glad Erich and her have been
        able to work things out. I hope it lasts this time. I picked up Contact and AI for 15 bucks, I love those
        movies. The Chronicles of Riddick was better than I had thought it would be, so I walked away from that movie
        pleasantly surprised. I am going to try and catch super size me this week, that looks like a good movie. In
        weight lifting Satuday I managed to do 195 on the bench and 175 on the incline. I will move up in Incline
        Saturday or Monday depending on how sore I am, and may try 200lbs on the bench. I am going to try and run every
        day now, I want to drop some fat and flab... I bought some ankle weights so I do weighted leg lifts (yay). I
        have some great friends who really care about me. Thanks you guys! Kind of an ADD post, expect something more
        coherent in the future.

        The realization Today on my way to lunch I found myself asking why I was having lunch with this woman. She and I
        have nothing in common. I find her annoying, very harsh and critical of the service she receives, and she doesnt
        like exotic food. She also doesnt eat bread. I guess maybe I could just be her friend, but I dont know. I open
        doors for her, she hugs me when we part... we share a dessert when we eat out.. Yet I cant really stand her or
        her attitude. I guess its the company and companionship... Play dating I would call it I guess. The reasonable
        man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.
        Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man. - George Bernard Shaw

        Bad workout today, I dunno I guess my mind just wasnt with it so I gave up.... we'll see how I do Saturday, but
        I could only get 3 full sets in at my target weight, four reps on the fourth set, then took 10lbs off and could
        only manage three reps... C'est la vie I suppose, but I am overly critical of myself... I knew I wasnt feeling
        it when I got home, so I should have just listened to that voice in my head. Probably has something to do with
        the lack of good solid sleep last night.... whatever no sense making excuses for myself.. I couldnt do it. Try
        as hard as we may for perfection, the net result of our labors is an amazing variety of imperfectness. We are
        surprised at our own versatility in being able to fail in so many different ways. Samuel McChord Crothers

        My new obsession. I realized that I have been kind of obsessing over my weight and counting calories again... My
        weight has remained very stable over the last few months. My ability to lift and bench has increased, but my
        body fat percentage has remained the same... maybe thats whats been giving me pause lately to re-examine my
        diet... I think I am probably overreacting though... I dont know how my percentage of body fat and weight can
        remain constant, yet I feel I am more toned and muscular looking... that should be all that is important... not
        what a scale reports. I have been putting too much emphasis and worry into trying to ensure I am not regaining
        body fat.... I look at old photos of me and I cant believe the difference. For those of you who might be
        stumbing across this here are a couple pics for reference. June 2002 June 2004

        Nice busy day at work, lots of long boring meetings... Today I am reminded why I hate Michigan... 90 degress and
        humid as a mofo... Went for a longer run than usual and it felt pretty good, I must have looked pretty terrible
        though, my shirt was drenched with sweat and was quite visible... maybe someday I will be able to feel
        comfortable running w/o a shirt on. Anyways, Im looking forward to working out tomorrow... Gonna try and do my
        bench sets at 195. Ive been coping alot better today than I have since Sunday... Maybe it was a bad idea to mix
        antidepressants and excessive amounts of Alcohol... Ah well time will tell. Dont seem to be getting any hits on
        the personal ads I posted... The Internet probably isnt a good place to meet women though, especially since they
        all expect the guy to pay the monthly fee to contact them... Suppose in some ways the Internet is no different
        than a bar. Some quote I happened Across "When we are loved we are afraid love will vanish when we are alone we
        are afraid love will never return and when we speak we are afraid our words will not be heard not welcome but
        when we are silent we are still afraid." --audre lorde, in "Litany for Survival"

        Have you ever stopped to think that maybe you were meant to be alone? Its still like a big black cloud looming
        over my head. I am preocupied with the things I have yet to accomplish in my life and trying to find faults
        within myself that explain why I am single. I am almost 25 years old. I have been on my own since I was 18, I
        have a new car, bought a house last year, I am successful and good at my job. I enjoy my job and the people. By
        most standards I have have a blessed life, but why is that I dont feel accomplished. It seems I put more
        importance on not having someone to share my life with than I do on just living my life. Its not something that
        happens all the time, but there are so many gentle reminders that stir these feelings inside of me. A friend of
        mine once told me: Everything turns out right in the end. If things arent right, then its not the end. Its so
        easy to give advice to others and not accept my own advice. I cant rush my life, things will happen on their own
        time table, I need to stop clinging to these desires and just live my life and let life happen. Or do I need to
        go out and make my own destiny, are we the instruments of our own destiny or merely a just part of some greater
        comsic plan for us?

        When I was a kid I used to pray every night for a new bike. Then I realised that The Lord doesn't work that
        way,so I stole one and asked him to forgive me.

        I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours But I think that God's got a sick sense of humor And when I die I
        expect to find Him laughing

        Chillin to some groove salad, studying BGP confederations and route reflectors... Four weeks until my CCNP
        lapses... I should probably schedule a dry run and see how I do, but that's an expensive lesson @ 185 bucks a
        test. Check out this shockwave flash... I cant believe someone took the time to make it... urlLink Come together
        The sun sets on another day, I had the most amazing dream this morning... I could feel myself smiling still when
        I woke up... I wish I could have held onto that thought all day.

        Ugh, I think I have allergies... My nose has been stuffed up all week making it damn near impossible for me get
        out and run since I cant breathe through my nose. I'll have to go to the DR and get a perscription for some
        Allegra or something I suppose. I need to recert my CCNP/CCDP by July 27th. I need to study and its going to be
        a rough schedule... If I fail to pass the exam, my CCNP and CCDP lapse... Maybe that isnt such a bad thing.
